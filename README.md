# Portal Cubed Rewrite

Portal Cubed is a Work-in-Progress Portal Mod for Quilt 1.20.2 that aims to bring most of the core gameplay mechanics from Valve's Portal series to Minecraft.

As of Alpha 1, the list of features includes:
- Prop entities, such as cubes, radios, and various decorations found around Aperture Laboratories
- Floor Buttons and Pedestal Buttons, including the Old Aperture versions, and the Portal 1 floor button style
- Most of the common test chamber building materials from all visual styles/time periods seen in Aperture Science, and a new tool known as the Construction Cannon to assist in the building of test chambers
- Decorative information signage, for cases such as informing your test subjects exactly how they are about to die
- The totally legitimate test completion reward, the Black Forest Cake
  
..With a lot more on the way!
